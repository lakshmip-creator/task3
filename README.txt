Objective
The goal of this task is to implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression using open-source tools.  
We use Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build, evaluate, and visualize regression models.  

Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas (data handling)  
- Scikit-learn (linear regression model)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)  

 Steps Followed
1. Imported and preprocessed dataset** (handled missing values, kept numeric columns).  
2. Split data** into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  
3. Trained Linear Regression model** using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.  
4. Evaluated performance** using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.  
5. Plotted regression line** (for simple regression).  
6. Plotted residuals** to check assumptions.  
7. Interpreted coefficients** to understand feature importance.  

 Visualizations
- Regression Line (for single feature)  
- Residual Plot (checking model assumptions)  

 Key Learnings
How linear regression works (simple vs multiple).  
How to evaluate regression models using **MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²**.  
How to interpret coefficients.  
Importance of checking assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, etc.).
